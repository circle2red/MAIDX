I’ll identify as a songwriter forever.”\n\nFurtado released “7,” her first album since 2017’s “The Ride,” in 2024. The artist explains that she is immensely happy that her discography, including three Billboard top ten hits, is being rediscovered by a new generation.\n\n“My music has reached a whole new generation of fans and I couldn’t be happier about that,” Furtado wrote. “To have so many people rediscovering my music has been surreal and joyful. It’s been so fun embracing this opportunity, getting back on stage, and seeing up close the true lasting power of good music. It’s made me really believe in magic.”\n\nFurtado’s final concert was during the Superbloom 2025 set in Munich on August 30. The singer expressed gratitude for everyone who helped her along in her career thus far.\n\n“I deeply thank all of those who have worked so hard to help me make my pop dreams come true on a creative and organizational level. I thank all my brilliant collaborators and loyal champions,” she wrote. "
