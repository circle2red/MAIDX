Acting immediately is paramount, as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has warned that attacks are already underway and issued a binding directive requiring federal agencies to update now. Here\u2019s what you need to know and do about CVE-2025-59287.\nForbesPayPal Users Warned \u2018Do Not Pay, Do Not Phone\u2019 As Attackers Strike\nBy Davey Winder\nMicrosoft Confirms Emergency Security Update For Windows Server Users\n\nLess than a week after CISA issued a warning for federal agencies to update Windows Server, Windows 10 and Windows 11 due to ongoing server message block attacks, lightning has struck twice for Windows Servers users. Now CISA has confirmed that attacks are underway that exploit CVE-2025-59287, a critical vulnerability within the Windows Server Update Service that can enable a hacker to remotely execute malicious code over the network.\n\nMicrosoft stated: \u201cThe WSUS Server Role is not enabled by default on Windows servers. Windows servers that do not have the WSUS server role enabled are not vulnerable to this vulnerability. If the WSUS server role is enabled, the server will become vulnerable if the fix is not installed before the WSUS server role is enabled.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur team ran a preliminary search for WSUS servers across the internet,\u201d Bas van den Berg, a cybersecurity researcher at Eye Security, said. \u201cThey looked for Internet Information Service servers with specific ports 8530 (http) or 8531 (https) on Shodan and Fofa and yielded approximately 8,000 servers.\u201d Eye Security then notified the relevant authorities, as well as threat intelligence sharing partners with whom it works alongside. According to an Eye Security LinkedIn post, which first confirmed active exploitation of CVE-2025-59287, its telemetry has revealed that there are now at least 2,500 WSUS servers still exposed and at risk across the world.\nForbesLastPass Warns \u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 Master Password Hack Attacks Ongoing\nBy Davey Winder\nAmerica\u2019s Security Agency Urges Every Organization To Update Now As Attacks Continue\n\nCISA, meanwhile, has issued a warning giving certain federal agencies just two weeks to ensure they do so under a binding directive. America\u2019s Security Agency also said that it \u201cstrongly urges organizations to implement Microsoft\u2019s updated Windows Server Update Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability guidance, or risk an unauthenticated actor achieving remote code execution with system privileges.\u201d\n\nCISA recommends the following course of action:\n\n    Identify servers that are currently configured to be vulnerable to exploitation.\n    Apply the out-of-band security update released on October 23, 2025, to all servers so identified.\n    Reboot WSUS servers after installation to complete mitigation.\n\nIf you cannot update right now, it is advised that the WSUS server role be disabled and that inbound traffic to ports 8530 and 8531 be blocked at the host firewall.\n\nMicrosoft said that it\u2019s important that Windows Server admins \u201cdo not undo either of these workarounds until after you have installed the update.\u201d I know it\u2019s the weekend, but hey, you know what to do.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "id": "call_00_odQCXeu7jbF0kffM4ZyEScik", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "run_python", "arguments": "{\"code\": \"from datetime import datetime\\n\\n# Extract date from the content\\n# The date appears as \\\"Oct 26, 2025, 05:24am EDT\\\"\\ndate_str = \\\"Oct 26, 2025\\\"\\ndate_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, \\\"%b %d, %Y\\\")\\nformatted_date = int(date_obj.strftime(\\\"%Y%m%d\\\"))\\nprint(formatted_date)\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_00_odQCXeu7jbF0kffM4ZyEScik", "name": "run_python", "content": "\"20251026\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Act Now \u2014 Microsoft Issues Emergency Windows Update As Attacks Begin\",\n  \"category\": \"Technology\",\n  \"reporter\": [\"Davey Winder\"],\n  \"date\": 20251026,\n  \"summary\": \"Microsoft has issued an emergency security update for a critical Windows Server vulnerability (CVE-2025-59287) that enables remote code execution.
