I got to try it\nBy\nLisa Eadicicco\nOct 22, 2025\n\nSamsungGalaxyXR.jpg\nSamsung\u2019s new Galaxy XR headset is here. What it\u2019s like to use\n\n\nYou can already use Google Maps to virtually \u201cexplore\u201d a city on the other side of the world without leaving your seat. But what if you could take that a step further by feeling like you\u2019re inside the map? And what if you could learn about the restaurant on the corner or a landmark in the distance just by looking at it and asking?\n\nThat ability to view apps on a much larger virtual screen and talk with a digital assistant that can see what you\u2019re seeing is one of the touted features of the Galaxy XR, Samsung\u2019s new mixed reality headset, which launched October 21 for $1,800. Samsung is one of many tech companies that have tried to make virtual and augmented reality headsets as pervasive as smartphones and laptops, although such devices are still a niche primarily appealing to early adopters, tech enthusiasts and gamers.\n\nThat includes Apple\u2019s $3,500 Vision Pro headset, which has struggled to attract developers and resonate with buyers, according to reports from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg. Both Apple\u2019s and Samsung\u2019s devices seek to establish a new type of headset that offers different levels of immersion, from virtual screens to digital environments that fully envelop a user\u2019s field of view.\nRelated article\nA woman plays a video game with the Oculus Rift VR headset at the mk2 VR, a place dedicated to virtual reality in Paris, France, December 5, 2016.\n\nTech promised virtual reality would revolutionize entertainment. That moment might finally be closer than we think.\n\nSamsung is hoping that its latest headset, which it developed in partnership with Google, will win over consumers with its implementation of the search giant\u2019s Gemini assistant. The digital helper is embedded throughout the headset\u2019s operating system, meaning it can answer questions about content being viewed in the device.\n\nThe new headset is not only Android\u2019s first major rival to the Vision Pro, but Samsung\u2019s and Google\u2019s gamble at what may be the next evolution of the personal computer, as tech giants race to supplant the smartphone with new AI-powered gadgets.\n\n\u201cIt does take you closer to that sort of Jarvis scenario from sci-fi of having a digital assistant that can really be a companion by your side, understand your context, and you can invoke actions as simply as having a conversation,\u201d Shahram Izadi, vice president and general manager of the Android XR software powering the headset, told CNN in an interview.\nSamsung's Galaxy XR headset is Android's answer to the Apple Vision Pro.\nSamsung's Galaxy XR headset is Android's answer to the Apple Vision Pro.\nMadeleine Stix/CNN\n\nLike Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, Samsung\u2019s headset is intended for productivity and entertainment. Wearers can view Android apps on a much larger virtual screen than a TV or computer monitor. Certain apps also work differently from what you\u2019d experience on a smartphone; images and videos in Google Photos can be viewed in 3D, similar to the Vision Pro\u2019s spatial photos.\n\nNavigating the software involves using hand gestures and speech, although the headset also has a button for summoning Google\u2019s Gemini and a touchpad.\n\nBut what really makes Samsung\u2019s headset stand out is the way it works with Gemini.\n\nWhen I asked questions about photos such as: \u201cWhat part of the world does that tree grow in?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s the best time of year to go to this location?\u201d Gemini not only responded but offered to book flight tickets.\nRelated article\nLeft: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg; right: Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\nThe rivalry between Meta and Apple is moving to a new playing field: virtual reality\n\nI had a similar experience when using Google Maps on the headset. As I panned around New York, I asked Gemini about points of interest without having to specify the location since it knew what I was looking at. Users must choose to share their screen with Gemini before asking questions about content they\u2019re viewing.\n\nThe headset felt relatively light to wear during my roughly 30-minute demo, and it was easier to adjust the headband\u2019s size compared to previous virtual reality headsets I\u2019ve tried. But it\u2019s still far heavier than a pair of glasses, so it\u2019s unclear how comfortable it will be to wear for long stretches of time.\n\nUsing Gemini in the Galaxy XR headset feels like a bigger shift toward using AI to get things done that may have previously required multiple steps or more than one app. Google has been reorienting its Android smartphones\u2019 software around this concept, with features like Circle to Search, which performs a Google search based on what\u2019s on your phone\u2019s screen.\nYou can navigate the headset's software using hand gestures.\nYou can navigate the headset's software using hand gestures.\nMadeleine Stix/CNN\n\nStill, Samsung and Google are wrestling with a difficult question: Is there room for yet another gadget in people\u2019s lives?\n\nVirtual reality headsets haven\u2019t taken off because the use case doesn\u2019t justify the price for most people. While $1,800 is far less expensive than the Apple Vision Pro, it\u2019s still a splurge for most households.\n\nBut Drew Blackard, senior vice president of mobile product management for Samsung Electronics America, said he thinks $1,800 could draw in consumers who weren\u2019t interested in virtual reality before.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged it\u2019s still a steep cost.\n\n\u201cIs that, you know, enough to drive mass market adoption? Probably not,\u201d he said in a CNN interview. \u201cYou probably need to see it come down over time.\u201d\n\nSamsung and Google see the Galaxy XR headset as a starting point for a new wave of AI-powered eyewear, including upcoming smart glasses.\n\nGoogle is already thinking about future use cases: Gemini will one day be able to track a user\u2019s expressions, said Izadi, although that functionality is currently in a prototype stage. Doing so could make chatting with Gemini feel more natural, he said, which could be key for a product like the Galaxy XR that was designed primarily with AI usage in mind.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine a world where, by understanding the user\u2019s emotions or their expressions, you can react accordingly,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch like the conversations that we\u2019re having in the real world.\u201d\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "id": "call_00_pMu52bsyDATCa9zQL9QGN7yV", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "run_python", "arguments": "{\"code\": \"from datetime import datetime\\n\\n# Extract date from the content\\n# The article shows \\\"Oct 22, 2025\\\" but the URL shows 2025/10/21\\n# Using the URL date as it's more reliable for the publication date\\ndate_str = \\\"2025-10-21\\\"\\ndate_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, \\\"%Y-%m-%d\\\")\\ndate_number = int(date_obj.strftime(\\\"%Y%m%d\\\"))\\nprint(date_number)\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_00_pMu52bsyDATCa9zQL9QGN7yV", "name": "run_python", "content": "\"20251021\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Samsung\u2019s big answer to the Apple Vision Pro is here.
