(Photo by Taylor Hill/Getty Images)\n\nRadiohead have revealed they will play in the round at their upcoming shows and have speculated on what will make up the setlists.\n\n    Read More: Jonny Greenwood tells us about The Smile\u2019s \u2018Cutouts\u2019 and the \u201cfun and natural\u201d Radiohead reunion\n\nThe band are preparing to play their first shows in over seven years, with four nights each in Madrid, Bologna, London, Copenhagen and Berlin to take place between November 4 and December 12.\n\nIn a new interview with The Times, the band have revealed that the shows will all be played in the round \u2013 with the audience surrounding the stage on all sides. It marks a departure from Radiohead\u2019s typical setup, although as drummer Philip Selway noted in the interview, \u201cwe\u2019ve actually done it once before,\u201d referring to a 1993 Canadian tour when they opened for Ned\u2019s Atomic Dustbin.\n\nInevitably, Radiohead fans have also been speculating about the makeup of the setlists for the upcoming shows, and the band confirmed that they have whittled their options down to a shortlist of approximately 65 tracks, which Jonny Greenwood said they were \u201call frantically learning\u201d.\n\nThom Yorke, Ed O\u2019Brien and Selway serve as the band\u2019s \u201csetlist committee\u201d, deciding on the setlist just hours before the start of every show, and they assured fans that the setlists will change from date to date. \u201cWe have too many songs,\u201d Yorke said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re contrary bastards,\u201d O\u2019Brien added.\n\nWhen asked what songs would be a lock for the shows, Yorke quipped: \u201cThere are no surprises\u201d.\n\nThe comments follow on from bassist Colin Greenwood telling The Adam Buxton Podcast in September: \u201cOh, I think it\u2019s going to be a mix set. I think we\u2019ve like whittled it down to about 70 songs. And me and my brother [guitarist Jonny Greenwood] are not on the setlist committee, we\u2019re not allowed, because we\u2019re too indecisive.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ll play anything in any order, at any time. We sort of take a busking attitude to the Radiohead setlist,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the first time I think we\u2019ve done shows where we haven\u2019t got new material to play as work in progress. But you never know, some stuff might come up or not or whatever, so.\u201d\n\nThey will be the first Radiohead shows since the end of their \u2018A Moon Shaped Pool\u2019 world tour in 2018, with the 77th and final show having gone down in Philadelphia\u2019s Wells Fargo Center in August of that year. The band have also not released any new music since the album of the same name, released in 2016.\n\nIn the new interview, they also shed light on why it has taken so long for the band to play together again. \u201cI guess the wheels came off a bit, so we had to stop,\u201d Thom Yorke explained. \u201cThere were a lot of elements. The shows felt great but it was, like, let\u2019s halt now before we walk off this cliff.\u201d\n\nHe also shared that he needed the time away from the spotlight because he had not given himself time to grieve the loss of his first wife Dr. Rachel Owen, who died in December 2016 from cancer at the age of 48. \u201c[My grief] was coming out in ways that made me think, I need to take this away,\u201d he explained.\n\nElsewhere in the new interview, the band members each reflected on the controversies stemming from their stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict, with Yorke saying the \u201clow-level Arthur Miller witch-hunt\u201d on the subject \u201cwakes him up at night\u201d.\n\nThe band were criticised for playing a show in Tel Aviv in 2017, Yorke got into a clash with a protester at a solo show in Melbourne in 2024 and Jonny Greenwood has been attacked for collaborating with and playing live with Israeli musician Dudu Tassa.\n\nYorke said he would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d play in Israel with the band again, but Greenwood \u201cpolitely disagreed\u201d with him, calling the backlash \u201cthe embodiment of the left\u201d, adding: \u201cThe left look for traitors, the right for converts and it\u2019s depressing that we are the closest they can get\u201d.\n\nThe Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, meanwhile, have argued that the band\u2019s \u201ccomplicit silence\u201d and support of Israeli performers during the \u201cgenocide against Palestinians in Gaza\u201d should lead to a boycott of their upcoming shows.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "id": "call_00_Guik9DqwQLcHwtvSk3XGDJ4p", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "run_python", "arguments": "{\"code\": \"from datetime import datetime\\n\\n# Extract date from the content: \\\"26th October 2025\\\"\\ndate_str = \\\"26th October 2025\\\"\\n\\n# Convert to YYYYMMDD format\\nparsed_date = datetime.strptime(date_str.replace('th', '').replace('st', '').replace('nd', '').replace('rd', ''), '%d %B %Y')\\nformatted_date = int(parsed_date.strftime('%Y%m%d'))\\nprint(formatted_date)\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_00_Guik9DqwQLcHwtvSk3XGDJ4p", "name": "run_python", "content": "\"20251026\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Radiohead reveal they'll be playing in the round on UK and European tour and talk setlists: \\\"We have too many songs\\\"\",\n  \"category\": \"Entertainment\",\n  \"reporter\": [\"Max Pilley\"],\n  \"date\": 20251026,\n  \"summary\": \"Radiohead will play in-the-round concerts for their upcoming UK and European tour, their first shows in over seven years.
